# STANDARD-MENUBAR-PROJECT
Creating a general menu bar with tkinter that has text widget with options like cut copy paste,undo,redo, find&amp;replace 
 and try to build special features once I learn how to build tags in later version.
This is a object oriented approach so I can namespace the variables. Kind of a work around to using the keyword global in normal short script coding.
This menubar is is some reusable for other projects.
